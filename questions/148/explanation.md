The issue here is not the missing initializer of the variable `a` - it will implicitly be initialized to `0` here. But the issue is the access to `a` twice without sequencing between the accesses. According to §[intro.execution]¶14, accesses of volatile glvalues are side-effects and according to §[intro.execution]¶17 these two unsequenced side-effects on the same memory location results in undefined behavior.
