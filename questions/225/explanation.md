First, a global `X object` is created, printing `1`.

Then `main` is called, and we get to the line `X(object);`. This can be interpreted in two ways:
1. As creating a temporary unnamed copy of `object`.
2. As creating a new variable of type `X` named `object`. This is easier to see if you remove the parentheses, and it becomes just `X object`.

§[stmt.ambig]¶1 in the C++ standard says:
> An expression-statement with a function-style explicit type conversion as its leftmost subexpression can be indistinguishable from a declaration where the first declarator starts with a `(`. In those cases the statement is a declaration.

So `X(object)` is in fact a declaration of a new variable `object` (which shadows the global `object`). The constructor is called, and `1` is printed again.

We then call `f()`, and `4` is printed.

Next, `main` exits, and the local `object` is destroyed, printing `2`. Finally, the global `object` is destroyed, again printing `2`.
