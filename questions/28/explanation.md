When the array is initialized, the default constructor is called once for each of the two objects in it.

Then we iterate over the array using `auto`, which in our case is deduced to be `A`. This means the copy constructor will be called before `f()` for each iteration, printing `BCBC`. (Just as if we had written `for (A x: a)`.)

If we want to avoid the copy constructor, we can write `for (auto& x : a)` instead. Then the loop would print `CC`. (Just as if we had written `for (A& x: a)`.)
