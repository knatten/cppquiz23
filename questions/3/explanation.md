This overload is ambiguous. Why?

There are two viable functions for the call `f(-2.5)`. For the compiler to select one, one of them needs to be better than the other, or the program is ill-formed. In our case, they are equally good, making the program ill-formed.

According to ยง[over.match.best] in the standard, a viable one-argument function is better than another if the conversion sequence for the argument is better. So why isn't the int conversion sequence better than the unsigned conversion sequence, given that the double is signed?

All conversions are given a rank, and both "double => int" and "double => unsigned int" are of type "floating-integral conversion", which has rank "conversion". See Table 19 in the standard and ยง[conv.fpint]. Since they have the same rank, no conversion is better than the other, and the program is ill-formed.
