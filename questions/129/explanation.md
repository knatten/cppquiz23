Here we are trying to initialize a `vector<char>` using two string literals, not two `char`s.

The initializer-list constructor for `template <class T>vector` is defined as `vector(initializer_list<T>)` by §[vector.overview] in the standard. In our case, `vector(initializer_list<char>)`.

The type of a string literal is "array of `n` `const char`" (§[lex.string]¶8), so clearly the initializer-list constructor is not a match.

This problem does however not result in a compiler error, since the compiler is able to find another constructor that matches!

§[over.match.list]¶1 explains the rules very clearly:
> When objects of non-aggregate class type `T` are list-initialized (...), overload resolution selects the constructor in two phases:
>
> — If the initializer list is not empty or `T` has no default constructor, overload resolution is first performed where the candidate functions are the initializer-list constructors (9.4.5) of the class `T` and the argument list consists of the initializer list as a single argument. [which we have seen didn't match].
>
> — Otherwise, or if no viable initializer-list constructor is found, overload resolution is performed again, where the candidate functions are all the constructors of the class T and the argument list consists of the elements of the initializer list. [in our case, the two string literals `","` and `";"` ].

Going back to §[vector.overview], we find this candidate:

```
template <class InputIterator> vector(InputIterator first, InputIterator last)
```

Note that the type of `InputIterator` has no link to the type of `T` in the `vector<T>`. So even if we are initializing a `vector<char>`, the two arguments can be of arbitrary type. The only requirement is that they confirm to the concept of `InputIterator`, which `const char[]` happens to do.

Now the constructor believes it has been passed two iterators to the same sequence, but it has actually been passed iterators to two completely different sequences, `","` and `";"`. §[forward.iterators]¶2 says: "The domain of == for forward iterators is that of iterators over the same underlying sequence.". So the result of this program is undefined.
