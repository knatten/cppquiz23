The standard defines some identifiers as reserved to the implementation.

§[lex.name]¶3:

In addition, some identifiers are reserved for use by C++ implementations and shall not be used otherwise; no diagnostic is required.

- Each identifier that contains a double underscore __ or begins with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter is reserved to the implementation for any use.
- Each identifier that begins with an underscore is reserved to the implementation for use as a name in the global namespace.
