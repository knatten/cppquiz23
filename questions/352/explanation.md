The `typedef` specifier provides a way for declaring a type alias. However, it does not introduce a new type-id. §[dcl.typedef]¶1 in the standard:

> A name declared with the `typedef` specifier becomes a typedef-name. A typedef-name names the type associated with the identifier ([dcl.decl]) or simple-template-id ([temp.pre]); a typedef-name is thus a synonym for another type. A typedef-name does not introduce a new type the way a class declaration ([class.name]) or enum declaration ([dcl.enum]) does.
