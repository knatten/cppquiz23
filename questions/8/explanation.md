`g(A a)` takes an object of type `A` by value, not by reference or pointer. This means that `A`'s copy constructor is called on the object passed to `g()` (no matter if the object we passed was of type `B`), and we get a brand new object of type `A` inside `g()`. This is commonly referred to as slicing.
