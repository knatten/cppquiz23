Unsigned integers have well-defined behaviour when they overflow. When you go one above the largest representable unsigned int, you end up back at zero.

According to §[basic.fundamental]¶2 in the C++ standard:

> The range of representable values for the unsigned type is 0 to 2<sup>*N*</sup> − 1 (inclusive); arithmetic for the unsigned type is performed modulo 2<sup>*N*</sup>.
