The `std::exit` function calls the destructors of all objects with static storage duration, but is not responsible for destroying local variables. Therefore, when `std::exit(0);` is called, only the destructor of `a` is called; `b` is a local variable and its destructor is thus not called.

§[support.start.term]¶9.1:
> First, objects with thread storage duration and associated with the current thread are destroyed. Next, objects with static storage duration are destroyed and functions registered by calling atexit are called. See [basic.start.term] for the order of destructions and calls. (Automatic objects are not destroyed as a result of calling exit().)
