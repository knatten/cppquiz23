§[temp.param]¶16 in the standard says:

> A *template-parameter* of a template *template-parameter* is permitted to have a default *template-argument*. When such default arguments are specified, they apply to the template *template-parameter* in the scope of the template *template-parameter*.

In this code snippet, the template template-parameter is `C`, and the scope of `C` is the function template `g()`. Therefore, the default template argument for `C` (which is `B`) is applied. This means that when `g<X>()` is called, it is equivalent to calling `g<X<B>>()`, which in turn calls `X<B>::f()`. As `X<B>::f()` is specialized to print `2`, the output of the program is `2`.
