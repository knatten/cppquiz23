The question is which of `I`, `J`, and `K` get incremented. This depends both on operator precedence, evaluation order and short-circuiting. All of these are defined in ยง[expr.log.or].

First, precedence. Operator precedence is not actually spelled out anywhere, but you can infer from the syntax below that `&&` (*logical-and-expression*) has higher precedence than `||` (*logical-or-expression*).

So `(++I || ++J && ++K)` will be equal to `(++I || (++J && ++K))`.

Next, evaluation order and short-circuiting:

> Unlike `|`, `||` guarantees left-to-right evaluation; moreover, the second operand is not evaluated if the first operand evaluates to `true`.

So we first evaluate `++I`, which is `2`. This evaluates to `true`, so the second operand (`++J && ++K`) is never evaluated, and `J` and `K` do not get incremented.

The result of that entire expression is `true`, and `1` is printed. We then print `I`, `J` and `K`, which now hold `2`, `1` and `1`, respectively.
