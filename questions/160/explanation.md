In the first line of `main`, we create a new `B` object, with an `A` pointer `b` pointing to it.

On the next line, we call `b->foo()`, where `b` has the static type `A`, and the dynamic type `B`. Since `foo()` is virtual, the dynamic type of `b` is used to ensure `B::foo()` gets called rather than `A::foo()`.

However, which default argument is used for the `int a` parameter to `foo()`? §[dcl.fct.default]¶10 in the standard:

> A virtual function call (§[class.virtual]) uses the default arguments in the declaration of the virtual function determined by the static type of the pointer or reference denoting the object. An overriding function in a derived class does not acquire default arguments from the function it overrides.

So `B::foo()` is called, but with the default argument from `A::foo()`, and the output is `B1`.
