`decltype` is used twice, once with `"Hello World"` and once with `a`. §[dcl.type.decltype]¶1 has the details:

For `decltype("Hello World")`, we have:

> — otherwise, if `E` is an lvalue, `decltype(E)` is `T&`, where `T` is the type of `E`;

A string literal is an lvalue, and its type is "array of n `const char`" (§[lex.string]¶1), so `decltype("Hello, World!")` is `const char(&)[14]`.

For `decltype(a)`, we have:

> — otherwise, if `E` is an unparenthesized *id-expression* (...), `decltype(E)` is the type of the entity named by `E`.

So `decltype(a)` is the type of `a`. The type of `a` is however *not* `const char(&)[14]`, but rather `const char*`, due to the following:

§[dcl.type.auto.deduct]¶3:

> If the *placeholder-type-specifier* is of the form *type-constraint<sub>opt</sub>* `auto`, the deduced type `T'` replacing `T` is determined using the rules for template argument deduction. (...) Obtain `P` from `T` by replacing the occurrences of *type-constraint<sub>opt</sub>* `auto` either with a new invented type template parameter `U` (...). Deduce a value for `U` using the rules of template argument deduction from a function call, where `P` is a function template parameter type and the corresponding argument is `E`. (...) `T'` is obtained by substituting the deduced `U` into `P`.

In other words, the type of `a` will be deduced the same way as if we passed "Hello, World!" as a template argument of a function.

§[temp.deduct.call]¶2.1:

> If `P` is not a reference type:
>
> — If `A` is an array type, the pointer type produced by the array-to-pointer standard conversion is used in place of `A` for type deduction;

where `P` is a template parameter and `A` is the type of the argument.

This means that the type of `a` is the result of array-to-pointer conversion of the type of "Hello, World!" (`const char(&)[14]`) which is `const char*`.
