The goal of this question is to demonstrate that the evaluation order of elements in an initializer list is specified (as opposed to the arguments to a function call).

§[dcl.init.list]¶4:

> Within the *initializer-list* of a *braced-init-list*, the *initializer-clauses*, including any that result from pack expansions (§[temp.variadic]), are evaluated in the order in which they appear.

If `h` took two `int`s instead of a `vector<int>`, and was called like this:

```
h(f(), g());
```

the program would be unspecified, and could either print `fg` or `gf`.
